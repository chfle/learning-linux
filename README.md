## Contributing

This is a learning project that can be extended with lots of cool features! Here's our wishlist:

### High Priority
- [ ] quiz system - add some questions after lessons so ppl actually learn stuff
- [ ] safe command simulator - tired of people breaking their systems lol
- [ ] Docker integration - each lesson in container (IMPORTANT)
- [ ] HACKER LEVEL - kernel exploits, rootkits, reverse eng (the fun stuff)
- [ ] red team track - pentest, social eng, osint
- [ ] docker labs for every lesson - isolated environments
- [ ] vulnerable VMs for hacking practice (legally obvs)
- [ ] CTF challenges - real security scenarios with flags
- [ ] advanced docker security - container escapes, privesc

### Medium Priority
- [ ] gamification would be cool - badges, streaks, maybe points?
- [ ] difficulty ratings + adaptive paths based on how user is doing
- [ ] integrate with man pages - linuxtutor man ls or something
- [ ] search lessons by keyword - basic feature we're missing
- [ ] distro-specific content - ubuntu vs arch commands are different
- [ ] track how long lessons take, performance metrics
- [ ] practice challenges / competitions - make it fun
- [ ] lesson feedback system - let users rate lessons
- [ ] community content tools - let others write lessons
- [ ] smarter prereq checking - don't let noobs jump to advanced
- [ ] kubernetes module - containers are huge now
- [ ] defensive security - malware analysis, incident response
- [ ] cloud pentest modules - aws/azure/gcp security
- [ ] network forensics + wireshark training

### Nice to Have
- [ ] certificates for completing stuff (people love showing off)
- [ ] progress charts in terminal would look sick
- [ ] bookmark favorite lessons
- [ ] multi-language support (spanish, french, etc)
- [ ] group learning features??? maybe overkill
- [ ] export progress to pdf/csv - managers love reports
- [ ] accessibility - voice narration for blind users
